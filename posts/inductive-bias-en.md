# Inductive Bias in Machine Learning

Inductive bias refers to the set of assumptions a learning algorithm uses to predict outputs given inputs that it has not encountered before. It's what allows the model to generalize beyond the training data.

Without inductive bias, learning would be impossible because the model would have no basis to choose one hypothesis over another.

Common types of inductive bias include:

- Preference for simpler models (Occamâ€™s razor)
- Smoothness assumptions (similar inputs produce similar outputs)
- Prior knowledge about the domain

Understanding and designing the right inductive bias is crucial to building effective machine learning models.
